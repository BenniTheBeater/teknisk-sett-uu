        <div class="subtitle-small">What was my role?</div>
        <div class="text">
            My role was mainly to make the common log. 
            <br>
            However i also made my own log aswell

        <div class="subtitle-small">What did I do?</div>
        <div class="text">
            I basically wrote the common log
            <br>
            I wrote a bit about what we did in a word document so that i wouldn't forget
            <br>
            Then i took what i wrote in the document, and wrote it in the log.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle-small">What problems did I face?</div>
        <div class="text">
            For me, and i think everyone in the group was that we kind of lacked productivity
            <br>
            I faced a problem with not knowing how to make the common log
            <br>
            But that problem was fixed by getting Julian to help
