        <div class="subtitle-small">What was the plan?</div>
        <div class="text">
            The plan was simple, make a website about Git and GitHub like instructed.
            <br>
            We went for a scrolling-style website, where the text is displayed vertically across the website,
            <br>
            this also allowed us implement a kind of flow into the website that we otherwise wouldn't be able to.

        <div class="subtitle-small">How did it go?</div>
        <div class="text">
            Most aspects of the website like the styling went well,
            <br>
            but the group didn't do much, so it ended up becoming Julian's freetime activity.
            <br>
            But other than that we didn't really face any major problems, and so it went quite well.
