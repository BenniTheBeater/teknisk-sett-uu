        <div class="subtitle-small">What was my role?</div>
        <div class="text">
            My role was to find facts about Git and write them into the text and link the font style poppins to our files.
            <br>
            Julian removed many of my text additions, but I hope he will let my newer ones be a part of the final product.

        <div class="subtitle-small">What did I do?</div>
        <div class="text">
            I spent a lot of time researching git and github commands so I could describe them accurately,
            <br>
            Most of the text I wrote about git was removed by Julian, first during the switch to English
            <br>
            and after he did a large amount of work on the log from home.

        <div class="subtitle-small">What problems did I face?</div>
        <div class="text">
            The main problem I faced was Julian removing my work and stealing my tasks.
            <br>
            I had some problems with the CSS document for my own log, but that was fixed rather quickly.
