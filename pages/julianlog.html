        <div class="subtitle-small">What was my role?</div>
        <div class="text">
            My role was to manage the group, and teach them about both Git and GitHub.
            <br>
            The group was hard to manage, but I did eventually finish the website as I worked at home.
            <br>
            Because of this, I became the main contributor for this project.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle-small">What did I do?</div>
        <div class="text">
            I did everything from the website structure, to the nav-bar and even the 3D graphics.
            <br>
            Although, not all was my doing, like for instance the separate logs.
            <br>
            I must also admit that I did replace much of what my group actually did,
            <br>
            and I therefore recommend that you take a look at the commit history to see what everyone did.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle-small">What problems did I face?</div>
        <div class="text">
            The main problem I faced was definitely the lack of productivity in the group,
            <br>
            and I was always busy just helping people, instead of working myself.
            <br>
            I also had some problems with how the javascript wouldn't load,
            <br>
            and I eventually fixed this issue by using a tool called Rollup.

        <div class="subtitle-small">Sources</div>
        <div class="text">
            Although most of the things I made on this website were provided by myself,
            <br>
            I did use ChatGPT in some places in order to get a starting point when writing about Git and GitHub.
            <br>
            I also used both the Three.js and Rollup documentation websites to get a grip on how to use those libraries.
            <br>
            And lastly, I also stole the website icon idea from <a href="https://breadskate.dev/" target="_blank">Laszlo's website</a>.
