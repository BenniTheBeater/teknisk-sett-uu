        <div class="subtitle-small">What was my role?</div>
        <div class="text">
            My role was to manage the group, and teach them about Git and GitHub.
            <br>
            It was hard to manage, although I did manage to finish the website in time anyways.

        <div class="subtitle-small">What did I do?</div>
        <div class="text">
            I did most of what is currently displayed on the website,
            <br>
            everything from the website structure, to the nav-bar and even the 3D graphics.
            <br>
            Although there were some things I didn't do by myself, like logging.

        <div class="subtitle-small">What problems did I face?</div>
        <div class="text">
            The main problem I faced was definitely the lack of productivity in the group.
            <br>
            But I also had some problems with how the javascript wouldn't load,
            <br>
            and I eventually fixed this issue by using a tool called Rollup.
